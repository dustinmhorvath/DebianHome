DebianHome
=============

#### A general server machine homepage. I'm currently making efforts to modularize and abstract things so it works on more diverse platforms with little intervention. I'm literally just cloning this into webroot folders and doing scheduled pulls for updates.

Formerly RaspberryHome, should work on all Debian-based platforms to a great extent.
